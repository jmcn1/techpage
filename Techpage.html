            <p>
                ISO9001 was created by the International Organization for Standardization to provide clarity around Quality Management. It defines all of the elements of a QMS that should be in place, and must be in place to achieve certification.

            <p>
                Anytime that a process deviates from pre-approved specifications or procedures, this is a Deviation. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                All deviations must be investigation to determine root cause. Identification of root cause allows the QA unit to assist operations with Corrective and/or Preventative Actions (CAPAs) to make any corrections and prevent future occurrences. </p>
            <p>    
                This information is also tracked to allow trend analysis, ensuring that repetetive issues are identified and appropriate actions taken.

                Change Control is a method of ensuring that any changes to approved documents, processes, or systems are maintained in a controlled state. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                By capturing what is being changed and when, then requiring approval to make the changes, utilizing Change Control is an appropriate method of Version Control.

                Quality is everyone's responsiblity! In order to maintain processes/systems in a compliant state all personnel must be trained prior to beginning work. Any processes or systems they will utilize as a part of their job should be included in training. </p> 
            <p>    
                This may be completed in a variety of ways; including, read and understand, on the job training, classroom training, e-training, etc.

                Auditing
            </Header>
            <p>
                Auditing can be split into internal and external. Internal auditing is a method for the QA unit to ensure that personnel/departments within the organization are executing their work in a compliant manner (with internal policies and procedures, as well as, regulatory requirements).
            </p>
            <p>    
                External audits are a way of ensuring those we conduct business with (vendors, suppliers, etc.) operate in a compliant way. The QA unit also holds responsiblity for hosting audits from external parties (vendors, regulatory bodies, etc.)

                Companies have several options when selecting or developing a Quality Management System. This can include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Commercially available systems, such as:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Veeva</li>
                            <li>MasterControl</li>
                            <li>TrackWise</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>On prem or Cloud solutions</li>
                    <li>Custom developed application</li>

                I'm honestly not sure what to do with this section, so we are going to add some random sections of code.

                While writing this page, I used new tags, such as <code>Section</code>, I also used common tags, such as <code>li</code>,<code>class</code>, <code>id</code> and <code>link</code> that have been used in previous exercises. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My plan is to come back to these projects at a later time and clean them up. Setting myself a reminder here to do that.
